# Hypersense Ultimate Non-Root Performance Script

🔥 **Hypersense Ultimate V1** 🔥

**Description:**
Hypersense Ultimate is a powerful **non-root Android performance optimization script** specifically designed to enhance mobile gaming on titles such as Free Fire, Free Fire Max, and PES. It focuses on providing **smooth gameplay, higher FPS stability, improved touch responsiveness, and lower latency** while balancing battery consumption and device temperature. The script runs automatically when a supported game is detected in the foreground, requiring no root access, making it safe for all compatible devices.

Key features include:
- **Dynamic Touch Sensitivity:** X and Y touch inputs adjust per game for precise control, ideal for competitive gameplay.
- **Adaptive Frame Booster (AFB) & FPS Simulation:** Stabilizes frame rates and minimizes lag spikes.
- **High-Power Mode Simulation:** Prioritizes CPU and GPU resources for the active game while reducing background tasks.
- **Network Optimization:** Prioritizes network traffic for the foreground game, reducing latency in online multiplayer sessions.
- **Battery & Temperature-Aware AI Engine:** Automatically adjusts performance when battery is low or device heats up, preventing throttling or overheating.
- **Animation & Background Process Control:** Temporarily disables animations and minimizes unnecessary background apps during gaming for smoother performance.
- **Real-Time Monitoring & Logging:** Tracks FPS, latency, and battery usage; logs stored in `logs/` for analysis.
- **Configurable Settings:** Personalized settings saved in `config/` with an easy menu interface to toggle VRAM simulation, high-power mode, restore defaults, and monitor system metrics.

Hypersense Ultimate is a complete, non-root solution that combines **dynamic touch scaling, FPS stabilization, network optimization, and AI-driven performance management**, providing users with a seamless and optimized gaming experience.
